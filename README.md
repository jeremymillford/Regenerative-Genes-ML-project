# Predicting Gene Sequence Regenerative Contributions 

This repository contains machine learning algorithms for predicting regenerative features from gene sequences in vertebrates. This is the final project for CHEM 277B.

### Repository Contents

This repository contains gene sequences from axolotl that code for proteins or functions related to regeneration. It also contains a script for one hot encoding the nucleotidesinto an array, and it contains a notebook with a convolutional neural network.
