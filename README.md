# 277B_Final_Project
Machine learning algorithms for predicting regenerative features from gene sequences in vertebrates. Final project for 277B

### Overview

This repository contains gene sequences from axolotl that code for proteins or functions related to regeneration. It also contains a script for one hot encoding the nucleotides
into an array, and it contains a notebook with a convolutional neural network.
